SMART DOOR LOCK 

The Smart Door Lock project is an advanced home security solution that combines Arduino Uno and a keypad to create a keyless entry system with enhanced security features. Unlike traditional locks, which are vulnerable to issues like key duplication and lock picking, the Smart Door Lock offers a high level of security by using a keyless entry system based on a user-defined code.

One of the key security features of the Smart Door Lock is its ability to resist unauthorized access. Users can define a unique access code, which can be easily changed to maintain security. Additionally, the project includes an LCD display to provide visual feedback, ensuring that users are always aware of the system's status.

Another important security feature is the project's ability to detect and respond to tampering attempts. The Smart Door Lock can be programmed to trigger an alarm or lockout mechanism in response to multiple failed entry attempts, effectively deterring potential intruders.

Overall, the Smart Door Lock project demonstrates the importance of integrating security features into modern home automation systems. By combining Arduino Uno with a keypad, this project provides a reliable and effective solution for enhancing home security, giving users peace of mind and confidence in their home's security.
